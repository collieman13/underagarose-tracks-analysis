# underagarose-tracks-analysis
Matlab script written by members of the parent lab for the purpose of tracking the migration of neutrophils in the underagarose chemotaxis assay. DOI: [INSERT HERE]
This code uses data quantified from imageJ plugin trackmate (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-022-01507-1) filters out data from non-responsive cells/noise and calculates chemotactic parameters such as speed, distance, and directionality.
